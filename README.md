# HSA Project

A website built for my GT HSA Technology Project

## Code Quality

- Commit messages aren't the nicest due to the time crunch
- Spaghetti code is present as I'm still learning

## Tools

- Shadcn component library
- Tailwind CSS
- Fonts with `next/font`
- Icons from [Lucide](https://lucide.dev)
- Dark mode with `next-themes`
